## Additional documents:

presentation.pdf: A short .pdf I used for a keynote for a presentation on this repo.

graph-champion-guide.pdf: a .pdf provided by Apollo GraphQL during a e-conference I attended that talks about their recommendation of how to bring GraphQL into a large org. This document and the conferences I attended is informed my philosophy on how to approach GraphQL.

the-graphql-guide.pdf: Honestly, never even looked at this. Much too long for my learning style but contains everything you need to know about GraphQL.
